# EIP-155: Simple Replay Attack Protection

**Type:** Standards Track (Core)  
**Author:** Vitalik Buterin  
**Hard Fork:** Spurious Dragon  
**Block Number:** 2,675,000  
**Chain ID (Mainnet):** 1  

---

## Overview

EIP-155 prevents **replay attacks across different Ethereum chains** by including the `chainId` in the transaction signing process.

---

## Specification

### Transaction Signing

For blocks **≥ 2,675,000**:

- Instead of hashing 6 RLP fields:
nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data


- Hash **9 RLP fields**:
nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data, chainId, 0, 0


- Signature parameter `v` must be:
v = {0,1} + chainId * 2 + 35


If only 6 fields are hashed (legacy behavior):
v = {0,1} + 27


---

### Signature Recovery

If:
v == chainId * 2 + 35 or chainId * 2 + 36


Then the transaction hash **must be recomputed using 9 fields** during signature recovery.

Legacy signatures with `v = 27 or 28` remain valid.

---

## Example

- nonce: 9  
- gasPrice: 20 gwei  
- gasLimit: 21000  
- to: `0x3535...3535`  
- value: 1 ETH  
- data: empty  
- chainId: 1  

Resulting signature:
v = 37

(`37` instead of `27` due to chainId inclusion)

---

## Rationale

By binding a transaction signature to a specific `chainId`, EIP-155 ensures:

- Transactions signed for one chain **cannot be replayed** on another chain
- Improved safety across mainnet, testnets, and Ethereum-based networks

---

## Summary

- Adds `chainId` to the transaction signing hash  
- Changes the calculation of `v`  
- Provides **chain-level replay protection**  
- Mandatory for modern Ethereum networks
